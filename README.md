        <p>
          Poor Internet connectivity due to various reasons can hamper the
          performance of a potential candidate and ruin their entire hardwork.
          It also decreases the accuracy of judgement of one's skills and
          knowledge. Nowadays, during the global pandemic, the educational
          sector has migrated online and even the exams are being conducted
          online without considering that not every one can manage to get fast
          and secured internet connectivity.
